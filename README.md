# Ddos-Anomaly-detector
DDoS Anomaly Detection System using a Random Forest model classifies network traffic (via uploaded .pcapng files) as “Benign” or “Attack.” Built with Flask, it performs feature extraction and preprocessing, then displays results with pie charts and bar graphs for real-time, user-friendly visualization of anomalies.
