# Ddos-Anomaly-detector
This project is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Anomaly Detection System designed to identify unusual network traffic patterns indicative of DDoS attacks in real-time. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the system uses Random Forest model to classify network traffic as either "Benign" or "Attack." The model was trained on a wide dataset, ensuring that the system can effectively distinguish between normal and anomalous traffic patterns.

The system is deployed as a web-based application using Flask. Users can upload a .pcapng file containing network traffic data, which is then processed on the backend. The data goes through feature extraction and preprocessing, followed by predictions from the trained models. Results are displayed on a dedicated results page, featuring visualizations (pie charts and bar graphs) that summarize the distribution of benign vs. attack traffic. This helps users quickly understand the nature and extent of anomalies detected.
